# Aroudra Thakur — Next.js Portfolio

Converted the single HTML page into a small Next.js website.

How to run:

1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000

Notes:

- "View All Experiences" now navigates to /experiences.
- Styles are ported into styles/globals.css (from original page).
- The "Call Me" arena and Email popup are implemented as React components.
- You can extend this project by adding /pages/projects.js, blog pages, or converting to the app router if desired.
